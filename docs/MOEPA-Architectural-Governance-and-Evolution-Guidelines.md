# MOEPA Architectural Governance and Evolution Guidelines

> **Audience:** Architects, engineers, and contributors — not executive briefings.
> Leaders evaluate proposals using business outcomes per MOEPA layer ([pitch strategy §0](pitch-strategy.md)).
> This document defines how implementations evolve; it does not replace the business-first narrative.

This repository follows the **MOEPA 5-Layer Framework** (Metrology, Ontology,
Epistemology, Praxeology, Axiology). These guidelines define non-negotiable
architectural evolution rules for all new features, integrations, and pull
requests.

## 1. Governance Over Abstraction

- Avoid vendor-locked orchestration (for example: native Bedrock-only tooling or
  LangChain glue-code that cannot be ported).
- Prioritize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standardized interface for
  all data and tool access.
- Any new capability must be defined as an MCP server, ensuring logic remains
  portable and independent of the host (Bedrock, self-hosted orchestrator, or
  equivalent runtime).

## 2. From Fragments to Semantic Objects

- **No "chainsaw chunking"**: all data ingestion must use document-aware semantic
  parsing (for example: Docling, Unstructured, or equivalent approaches).
- Every data object must include provenance, structure, and semantic metadata.
- All chunks are considered **Proto-SPOs** (Sovereign Processing Objects); they
  must carry their own context to ensure semantic intent is preserved.

## 3. The MOEPA Standard for New Features

Every maintainer pull request must score its impact across the five layers:

- **Metrology**: how is this feature measured?
- **Ontology**: does this align with our canonical entity definitions?
- **Epistemology**: where is the evidence and provenance chain? (must return exact
  citations)
- **Praxeology**: what deterministic workflow does this feature serve?
- **Axiology**: does this feature comply with our internal governance and
  security filters?

## 4. MCP-First Pattern

- Do not call data or RAG layers directly.
- Implement all service logic within an MCP-compliant service.
- If a legacy API is required for throughput, it must be wrapped in an MCP facade
  to ensure visibility to AI orchestrators.

## Maintainer Pull Request Gate (Required)

> This gate applies to **maintainer-authored pull requests** that implement accepted issues or RFCs. External contributors should open issues or Proposal / RFC issues — not pull requests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

All substantive maintainer pull requests should include a short section in the PR
description documenting:

1. The MCP server or MCP facade introduced or reused.
2. The ingestion/parsing approach and Proto-SPO metadata fields.
3. Five-layer MOEPA impact notes (Metrology through Axiology).
4. Citation and provenance behavior in generated outputs.
5. Any exceptions and approved compensating controls.

If a proposal cannot map to these requirements, it should be scored as
CONDITIONAL GO or NO-GO under the MOEPA intake rubric.
