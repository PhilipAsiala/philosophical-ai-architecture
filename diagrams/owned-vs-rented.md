## The Key Differences

    quadrant-1 Ideal — Own and Audit
    quadrant-2 Can Audit, Cannot Own
    quadrant-3 Cannot Own, Cannot Audit
    quadrant-4 Own, But Cannot Audit
    Vendor Black-Box: [0.1, 0.1]

## Layer-by-Layer Comparison Table

| Layer | Rented (Vendor) | Owned (MOEPA) | Migration Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Substrate** | Vendor platform; export limited by contract | Open-format lakehouse (Iceberg/Parquet); fully portable | HIGH — historical data may not transfer |
| **Metrology** | Vendor manages quality rules and lineage | Organization-defined quality gates; full provenance records | HIGH — rules and history stay with vendor |
| **Ontology** | Vendor-defined entity model; schema not exportable | Organization-owned knowledge graph (Neo4j); version-controlled | HIGH — entity relationships may not transfer |
| **Epistemology** | Vendor confidence scores; no source access | Owned RAG; source-cited verification; confidence decomposed | MEDIUM — pipeline can be rebuilt with owned data |
| **Praxeology** | Vendor workflow engine; audit access limited | Owned state machine (LangGraph); immutable audit log | MEDIUM — workflow logic can be re-documented |
| **Axiology** | Vendor-provided guardrails; not inspectable | Policy-as-code (OPA); organization-defined; tested regularly | LOW — policy code is portable |
| **Compute / Models** | Rented cloud compute + API-accessed models | Rented cloud compute + open-weight models (Llama, Mistral) | LOW — compute is commodity |

## When Renting Is Acceptable

Not all renting creates unacceptable risk. The decision depends on what is being rented:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q1{"Does this vendor\ncontrol any of:\n- Your data\n- Your definitions\n- Your truth standards\n- Your decision logic\n- Your values/policy?"}

    Q1 -->|"YES"| Q2{"Is there a\ncontractual path to\nfull data/logic export?"}
    Q1 -->|"NO"| SAFE["✅ SAFE TO RENT\n(compute, infrastructure,\npre-trained model weights)"]

    Q2 -->|"YES with\nopen formats"| CONDITIONAL["⚠️ CONDITIONAL RENT\nAcceptable with:\n- Data portability clause\n- Audit access clause\n- Exit plan documented"]
    Q2 -->|"NO or unclear"| AVOID["❌ AVOID\nThis creates strategic\nlock-in. Require ownership\nbefore proceeding."]

    style CONDITIONAL fill:#4a3a1a,color:#ffffff
    style AVOID fill:#4a1a1a,color:#ffffff

## The Long-Term Cost Curve

| Year | Rented Architecture | Owned Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | Low cost; fast start; vendor manages complexity | Higher up-front investment; team capability building required |
| Year 2–3 | Vendor lock-in solidifying; switching cost rising | Compounding returns; data and logic assets accumulate value |
| Year 5+ | Vendor renewal leverage gone; costs and dependency high | Full sovereignty; costs declining; portable to any infrastructure |
| Oversight event | Cannot independently respond; dependent on vendor | Full audit capability from owned records |
| Policy change | Must request vendor update; timeline uncertain | Update owned policy-as-code; deploy immediately |

---

## Summary

> **The rented architecture is faster to start and slower to own.**  
> **The owned architecture is slower to start and faster to govern.**

For any organization with statutory audit obligations, long-term data custody requirements, and accountability to stakeholders or oversight bodies — the owned architecture is not just better strategy. It is the only defensible approach.
