# Metrology Capabilities

## What Leaders Need to Know

Bottom line: an organization that controls its data foundation can make more defensible decisions, withstand audit scrutiny, and avoid long-term dependency on external platforms.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the strategic rationale and [Business Value](../../docs/business-value.md) for the investment lens.

## Mission and Governance Outcomes

- Trustworthy decision-making based on governed source data.
- Better audit readiness through lineage, provenance, and replay.
- Reduced vendor lock-in by owning storage, metadata, and control boundaries.
- Stronger privacy and records-management posture for regulated workloads.

## What Metrology Covers

| Capability Domain | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data ingestion and validation** | Controls for what data enters the system and how it is checked |
| **Data quality measurement** | Ongoing measurement of completeness, accuracy, consistency, and freshness |
| **Provenance and lineage** | Tracking where data came from, how it was transformed, and who validated it |
| **Observability and monitoring** | Real-time visibility into data health, drift, and anomalies |
| **Storage and portability** | How data is stored to ensure ownership and long-term access |

## Core Capabilities

### M1 — Data Quality Rules Engine
**What it does:** Enforces defined quality rules at ingestion — completeness thresholds, format validation, range checks, referential integrity.

**Why it matters for government:** A tax system relying on W-2 data with 15% null fields in the employer EIN column will produce systematically incorrect income matches. Quality rules catch this before it propagates.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** Basic rules exist for core fields; failures are logged and escalated.

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** Automated quality profiling on every ingestion batch; failures block downstream processing; quality metrics are published and tracked over time.

---

### M2 — Data Provenance Recording
**What it does:** Creates and maintains a record of each data item's origin, collection context, and transformation history.

**Why it matters for government:** When a constituent challenges a decision, the agency must demonstrate that the underlying data was collected lawfully, from an authorized source, and processed correctly. Provenance is the evidence chain.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** Source system, collection date, and basic transformation steps recorded per record.

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** Cryptographic fingerprinting of source records; immutable audit log of all transformations; chain-of-custody from source to model input.

---

### M3 — Statistical Profiling and Drift Detection
**What it does:** Continuously measures the statistical properties of data (distributions, null rates, value ranges) and alerts when those properties change unexpectedly.

**Why it matters for government:** Model behavior can degrade silently when input data distributions shift — for example, when a third-party income reporter changes their reporting format. Drift detection catches this before it causes systematic errors.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** Periodic profiling with manual review of major anomalies.

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** Automated continuous profiling; alerting on statistical drift with defined thresholds; trend tracking over time.

---

### M4 — Open-Format Data Storage
**What it does:** Stores all data in open, non-proprietary formats that can be read and migrated without vendor cooperation.

**Why it matters for government:** Proprietary data formats create hard lock-in. When a contract ends, you need your data — not a vendor's promise to provide an export.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** Core data exportable in a standard format (CSV, JSON, Parquet).

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** All data stored natively in open-format lakehouse (Iceberg + Parquet); no proprietary format dependencies; self-hosted storage with full agency control.

---

### M5 — Data Access Controls and Egress Logging
**What it does:** Enforces who can access what data, and logs all access events for audit purposes.

**Why it matters for government:** Privacy Act, FOIA, and cybersecurity requirements all depend on knowing who accessed what data and when. Egress logging is the evidentiary foundation.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** Role-based access control enforced; access logs available for audit.

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** Zero-trust access model; real-time egress monitoring; automated alerts on unusual access patterns; logs tamper-evident and retained per retention schedule.

---

### M6 — Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) Availability Assessment
**What it does:** Prior to ingestion, determines whether the required source data is already available, governed, and staged within the enterprise data platform (EDP / lakehouse) or whether it must be newly provisioned or supplied by the customer team. This assessment directly informs ingestion timelines, cost, and risk.

**Why it matters for government:** Customer-supplied data pipelines create hidden integration debt, duplicate storage, and delayed delivery. Explicitly checking EDP availability enforces reuse of existing enterprise assets and prevents unnecessary data movement.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** Basic statement of data source is provided.

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** Formal EDP availability check is completed and documented before project intake proceeds; data already present in the governed platform is used by default; customer-supplied data is accepted only with explicit justification and timeline impact assessment.

---

### M7 — Post-Launch KPI Measurement and Objective Baselining
**What it does:** Establishes objective pre-launch performance and data quality baselines and implements a scheduled post-launch measurement program for model effectiveness, data drift, outcome KPIs (accuracy, equity, cost-per-transaction, throughput, compliance rates), and business impact.

**Why it matters for government:** Without post-launch baselining and measurement, leadership cannot determine whether an investment delivered the promised ROI or created unintended consequences. This capability closes the governance loop.

**Minimum acceptable standard (Score 3):** High-level commitment to measure outcomes after launch.

**Good practice (Score 4–5):** Pre-launch baselines are captured and recorded in the catalog; a documented post-launch KPI measurement schedule (with owners and reporting cadence) is in place; results feed back into Axiology ROI validation and future intake decisions.

## Capability Matrix

The matrix below binds the minimum set of Metrology capabilities to **Score 3 — Defined & Contained — Minimum Acceptable Standard** in the existing [Metrology scoring guide](scoring.md). Capabilities that contribute to Scores 4 and 5 lift the layer beyond that baseline. Live delivery status should be tracked through the [Praxeology workflow](../praxeology/tools.md); the JIRA epic column below is illustrative only.

| Capability | Minimum set? (Score 3) | Maturity contribution (3 / 4 / 5) | Owner | Delivery tracking (illustrative: JIRA epic) |

| Post-launch KPI measurement, objective baselining, and drift reporting | No | 4 / 5 — closes the governance loop by proving whether promised business outcomes and ROI were achieved | Data platform + Business owner | Illustrative: JIRA epic for KPI baseline capture and scheduled measurement program |

## Questions Leaders Should Ask Before Funding

- Is the authoritative data source internal, governed, and contractually controllable?
- Can the team show where every critical dataset came from and how it changed over time?
- Are data quality failures blocked before they affect downstream decisions?
- If the current platform or vendor changes, does the organization retain its data and metadata?
