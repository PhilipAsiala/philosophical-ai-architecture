# Metrology Patterns and Anti-Patterns

## Why These Patterns Matter to Leaders

Weak data patterns do not stay technical for long. They surface as audit failures, unreliable decisions, compliance gaps, and unexpected vendor dependence.

## Durable Governance Patterns

- **Data Contract First**: publish schema contracts before ingestion changes
- **Bronze/Silver/Gold Zones**: separate raw, cleaned, and production-grade data
- **Quality Gate Pipelines**: block promotion when validation thresholds fail
- **Immutable Event Logs**: retain append-only records for replay and forensics

## Named Implementation Patterns

### Pattern M-A: Ingestion Quality Gate
All incoming data passes through a defined quality rules engine before being written to the Data Substrate. Records failing quality checks are quarantined, logged, and escalated — never silently passed through or discarded.

```
Source Data → Quality Rules Engine → PASS → Data Substrate
                                  → FAIL → Quarantine + Alert + Escalation Log
```

### Pattern M-B: Immutable Provenance Record
Every record written to the Data Substrate includes a provenance header containing: source identifier, collection timestamp, ingestion pipeline version, quality check results, and a content hash. This header is immutable after write.

### Pattern M-C: Statistical Baseline and Drift Alert
On first ingestion, a statistical baseline is computed for each data asset (field distributions, null rates, range bounds). On each subsequent ingestion, current statistics are compared to the baseline; deviations exceeding defined thresholds trigger alerts before downstream processing.

### Pattern M-D: Semantic Document Ingestion (Proto-SPO)
Unstructured documents pass through document-aware semantic parsing (Docling, Unstructured, or equivalent) before entering the Data Substrate. Each output segment is a Proto-SPO carrying provenance, structural metadata, and semantic context — not a fixed-size text chunk.

```
Source Document → Semantic Parser → Proto-SPO (provenance + structure + metadata)
                                 → Quality Gate → Data Substrate (SPO-compatible)
                                 → MCP Ingestion Server (orchestrator access)
```

Orchestrators invoke ingestion through an MCP server — never by calling parsers or storage APIs directly. See [Architectural Governance Guidelines](../../docs/MOEPA-Architectural-Governance-and-Evolution-Guidelines.md).

## Costly Patterns to Avoid

- **Chainsaw chunking**: fixed-size text splits that discard document structure, table boundaries, and semantic intent
- **Orchestrator-direct ingestion**: parsers or data layers called from Bedrock/LangChain glue without an MCP boundary

- Hidden ETL logic in unmanaged scripts with no version control
- Exclusive dependence on proprietary catalogs for lineage truth
- Manual schema changes without compatibility checks
- Data quality checks that only alert but never gate usage

## Common Weaknesses to Watch For

| Weakness | Risk | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Vendor owns data lineage records | Cannot produce independent audit trail | "We would need to request that from our data provider" |
| No quality rules on third-party data | Garbage enters the system undetected | No documented data quality framework |
| Data stored in proprietary format | Lock-in; migration becomes expensive | Data only accessible through vendor API |
| No egress logging | Privacy Act and security compliance gaps | "We log access at the application level but not the data level" |
| Quality checks happen downstream | Errors propagate before detection | Quality issues discovered when model outputs are wrong |

## What Leaders Should Watch For

- Catalog drift where metadata does not match actual pipeline behavior
- Time-travel gaps due to retention settings not aligned to compliance needs
- Untracked data access in privileged service accounts
