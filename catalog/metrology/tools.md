# Metrology Tools

## Executive Summary

These tool categories matter because they determine whether the organization owns its data foundation or depends on external platforms for storage, metadata, and governance. Leaders should treat tool selection as a sovereignty decision, not just a procurement choice.

## Recommended Self-Hosted and Open Options

| Capability | Tools | Leadership Decision Lens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingestion and orchestration | Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Airbyte, Apache Airflow | Prefer options that keep ingestion logic under institutional control and easy to inspect. |
| Storage and versioning | Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, MinIO | Favor open formats and portable storage so the data foundation can move without replatforming risk. |
| Catalog and metadata | DataHub, OpenMetadata, Apache Atlas | Metadata ownership is strategic. Avoid making a vendor portal the only source of lineage truth. |
| Data quality | Great Expectations, Soda Core, Deequ | Quality controls should be enforceable and reviewable, not informal or hidden inside pipelines. |
| Access and governance | Apache Ranger, OPA, Keycloak | Access decisions should be auditable and aligned to enterprise identity and policy controls. |

## Leadership Guidance

- Avoid vendor-only metadata lock-in for core datasets.
- Store schema and quality rules as code with review workflows.
- Require exportable lineage and provenance records.
- Cross-check high-impact choices against [Business Value](../../docs/business-value.md) and the [Owned-Brain Strategy](../../ARCHITECTURE.md).
